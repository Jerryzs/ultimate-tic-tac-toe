# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

The program allows the player to play the game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe againt a
computer opponent using a command-line interface.
[Ultimate tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe) is a
variant of the traditional tic-tac-toe board game, where each of the 9 squares
on the tic-tac-toe board is replaced with a completely seperate game of
tic-tac-toe.

The player plays against an algorithm that takes into account a number of
calculations (like minimaxing) to attempt to find the best counter every time
the player makes a move.
